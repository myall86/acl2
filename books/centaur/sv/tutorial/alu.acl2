; (Matt K. mod): Turning off waterfall-parallelism because of an error
; it caused for the theorem
; sv-tutorial-glcp-geval-apply-agrees-with-sv-tutorial-glcp-geval-ev.
; It could be turned off for just that theorem, but here we prevent
; future possible failures of that computed hint, which returns a
; value, when waterfall-parallelism is active.
