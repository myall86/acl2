<h2>Module Browser</h2>

<p>This is the default main page.  You can customize this page by
copying "centaur/vl/server/public" to a new directory, replacing this
main.html with your customized version, and supplying
"--public=your-public-dir" as an argument to "vl server".</p>

<h4>Missing Features from version 2.0</h4>

<ul>

<li>Pictures of the module hierarchy (requires calling out to dot)</li>
<li>Git blame in the browser (requires calling out to git)</li>
<li>Links to github, current hash, etc.</li>
<li>Comment system (silly, scrap it?)</li>

</ul>

<h4>Known Problems and Wishlist</h4>

<ul>

<li>A garbage collection can take the server a full minute, and the user has no
idea that this is happening. It may look like your browser is waiting for a
page.</li>

<li>It would be nice to have a hierarchical way of navigating the design, i.e.,
top-level modules first.</li>

</ul>
