Usage: vl <command> [arguments]

Commands:

  help    Print this message, or get help on a particular VL command
  lint    Find potential bugs in a Verilog design
  gather  Collect Verilog files into a single file
  server  Start a VL web server for web-based module browsing
  shell   Interactive VL shell (for experts)
  zip     Save a .vlzip file for the VL web server

Use 'vl help <command>' for help on a specific command.

    :long ,(cat "<p>The VL Toolkit (``kit'') is a standalone program that lets
you use various parts of VL from the command-line.  It currently includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Verilog/SystemVerilog linter, @(see vl-lint)</li>
<li>A server that powers a web-based module browser, @(see vl-server)</li>
<li>A shell for launching @(see acl2) with VL pre-loaded, @(see vl-shell)</li>
<li>Some miscellaneous commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the kit is intended to be a <b>convenient, but not complete</b>
way to use VL.  We generally intend VL to be a useful ACL2 library, not a
standalone program.  Most VL functions don't have any command-line
wrappers.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>To build the kit, just run @('make vl') in the @('acl2/books') directory.
This should produce an executable at @('acl2/books/centaur/vl/bin/vl').</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The top-level @('vl') program is really just a wrapper for several
sub-commands:</p>

@({" *vl-generic-help* " })

<h3>Extending the Kit</h3>

<p>If you develop your own VL functionality, you can create an extended kit
that knows how to run your additional commands.  See in particular @(see
vl-toolkit-other-command).</p>")))
