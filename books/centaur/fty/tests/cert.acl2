(include-book "../portcullis")

; Added by Matt K. 1/7/2016 because I couldn't debug a reproducible failure
; with ACL2(p) for (defoption maybe-monster ...) or (defoption maybe-monster2
; ...) in doc.lisp.  I tried my usual trick of :trans1 and then replacing a
; make-event by evaluation of its body, and I also tried LD; the error
; disappeared both ways.  Certification was hanging with the line
;   Waiting for all proof threads to finish
; repeated indefinitely.  The same issue appeared for terms.lisp.
