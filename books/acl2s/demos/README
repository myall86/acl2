The directory contains case-studies used for experimental evaluation
of Cgen.  All books, i.e., lisp files can be certified using
build/cert.pl.  Other scripts, i.e., .lsp files are meant to be
interactively replayed in an ACL2 session. You can either use Emacs or
ACL2 Sedan as the user interface.

* Testing Dijstra's shortest path algorithm using Fixers
- The relevant books are prefixed dsp-*.lisp
- dsp-defuns and dsp-defthms was refactored from
  misc/dijsktra-shortest-path.lisp book.
- The test? forms in the dsp.lsp script were translated from the above
  book. These forms can be evaluated from command line using cert.pl.
- The tables in harshrc's dissertation were populated using the awk
  script included in this directory. The following commands can be
  used to replay the experiment:
  : cp dsp.lsp dsp.lisp
  : build/cert.pl dsp.lisp
  : awk -v lo=5 -v hi=95 -f regress-stats.awk dsp.cert.out | less


* Finding hazards in 3-staged Pipeline Machine
- The relevant scripts are refinement-sfm06-with-hazards.lisp and
  refinement-sfm06-with-hazards-test.lsp.
- The data and control hazards are indicated as comments in the former
  book.
- Evaluate the forms in refinement-sfm06-with-hazards-test.lsp script
  in an ACL2 session
