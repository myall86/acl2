This is an updated copy of the material at

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/talks/marktoberdorf-08/

which was originally presented in 2008 at the Marktoberdorf Summer
School.

There are five sets of files, lecture*, each used in the corresponding
slides lecture*.pdf.  The demos are in files lecture*-input.lsp.  The
lecture*-log.txt files show the entire sessions (user input and ACL2
output), omitting from summaries the "Time" and "Prover steps counted"
fields.  The *-book.* files are artifacts of the ACL2 regression test
mechanism, and can be ignored by readers.

As a complete aside, note that among the books are some are probably
ancestors of books now in the ACL2 Community Books, but preserved so
that the demos will continue work even if someone changed those books.
As a matter of principle it's probably wise to keep copies of books
used in demos.  For example, if m1 had been changed significantly one
might have had to rewrite the m1 code for the Boyer-Moore fast string
searching algorithm which is verified here.  As it is, that proof just
uses the really simple machine called m1 back then (which may or may
not be exactly what we call it today).
