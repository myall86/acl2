This directory contains material about ACL2 presented by J Moore on
July 6 and 7, 2017, at the Big Proof workshop
<https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/bpr> at the Isaac Newton Institute for
Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge, England.

There are two sets of files, for the two talks ("talk1" and "talk2").
The *.pdf files are the slides from the two talks.  Each talk included
several demonstrations of a live ACL2 session.  The scripts for each
demo are in the *-input.lsp files, which consist of ACL2 commands,
definitions, theorems, etc., which were submitted to ACL2 during the
demos.  The slides have occasional headers named ``Demo 1'', ``Demo
2'', etc., and each corresponds to a sequences of commands in the
talk1 or talk2 lisp files.  The two *-log.txt files show the entire
sessions (user input and ACL2 output), omitting from summaries the
"Time" and "Prover steps counted" fields.  We expect the scripts will
re-play in future ACL2 versions.  The *-book.* files are artifacts of
the ACL2 regression test mechanism, and can be ignored by readers.
