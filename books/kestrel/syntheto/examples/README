Status of Example Files

Largest example: Point in Polygon
The definitive version is in 3 files
   point_in_polygon.mnb
   point_in_polygon.synth
   point-in-polygon.lisp
The .mnb works up until a few transforms that the fron end doesn't handle. The .lisp is complete.

The maximal subset of this derivation that works, except that the output is not printed
correctly for the 2 penultimate trransformations, are in:
   point_in_polygon_4.mnb
   point_in_polygon_4_1.mnb
   point_in_polygon_4.synth
   point-in-polygon-4.lisp
The 4_1 version is the same as _4 except that everything is in one code block so it is easy to process in Visual Studio Code.

A smaller example of transformation is Sum of Squares:
   sum_squares.mnb
   sum_squares.synth
   sum-squares.lisp

and Factorial:
   fact.lisp
   fact.mnb

There is a simple isomorphism example that currently does not work:
   isomorphism.mnb
   isomorphism.synth
   isomorphism.lisp

Examples without transformation are:

The beginnings of a rational model:
   rational.lisp

The beginnings of an aircraft model
   ams-spec-v0.lisp
   ams-spec-v0.synth
