The Axe Toolkit
===============================

This directory contains Kestrel's Axe toolkit, which we are currently
open sourcing.  A significant set of functionality is already present
here, and we plan to open source more of the toolkit as needed.

Tools of interest may include rewriter-basic.lisp and prover-basic.lisp.

The jvm/ directory contains Axe lifters for JVM bytecode programs.

The x86/ directory contains Axe lifters for x86 binary programs.

For more information, see the [Axe Webpage][Axe].
