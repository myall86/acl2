The FM9001 microprocessor design was originally specified and verified
in the Nqthm logic by Brock and Hunt using the DUAL-EVAL system. We
have converted it to the ACL2 logic using the DE system, the successor
to DUAL-EVAL.

Book Certification
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To certify books, execute the following:

make ACL2=<Path of the ACL2 image>

To remove certificate files, etc., execute the following:

make clean ACL2=<Path of the ACL2 image>

See Makefile file for the detail.

The DE simulator is implemented in de.lisp.

See simulate.lsp for an example of simulating FM9001

The memory model is specified in memory.lisp.

The monotonicity property for simulation is established in
approx.lisp.

Our final statements about the correctness of the FM9001
microprocessor are described in the last three lemmas in
final-reset.lisp.
