See ../README for information about this project for checking lrat
proofs.

This directory is a variant of ../stobj-based/ that implements a
slightly more efficient checker by assuming that for every clause
(l1 l2 ... lk) specified for addition in a given proof, the literals
(l2 ... lk) are sorted by absolute value.
