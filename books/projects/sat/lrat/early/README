See ../README for information about this project for checking lrat
proofs.

The checkers in these subdirectories are precursors of the ones
parallel to this directory, as follows.

drat/
  This slight variant of Nathan Wetzler's ITP 2013 checker adds
  deletion to that checker.

rev1/
  This is the first checker that accepts lrat (Linear RAT) proof input
  files.

rev2/
  This variant of rev1/ can heuristically shrink the formula's
  fast-alist from time to time.  The list-based checker (parallel to
  this early/ directory) is just a slight clean-up of rev2/.
