This directory contains ACL2 proofs of bounded convergence time for
the Distributed Perimeter Survelance System, Algorithm A (DPSS-A).

/Util: A collection of ACL2 utilities useful in the DPSS proof.

/Base: A formalization of the DPSS-A algorithm.

/AvD: A mechanization of the Avigad-Van Doorn hand proof of bounded
convergence time for DPSS-A

/Collins: A(n incomplete) proof of DPSS-A convergence that employs
multiple layers of behavioral abstraction.
