This directory contains test cases that document the differences
between the x86isa interpreter and a real x86 processor.  Serious
differences are fixed (but test cases left here for reference) and
those resulting from intentional design decisions are logged for
documentation.  An example of the latter is in the file
disp-immed-fault.lsp.
