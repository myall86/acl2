NOTE: This README is for files originally distributed as part of the
ACL2 system: acl2-doc-open-url.el, acl2-doc.el, emacs-acl2.el, and
monitor.el.  Other files in this directory are available (as of this
writing, fancy-string-syntax.el).

NOTE: This directory is intended for recent Emacs versions.  If you
are using Emacs 24, consider using files in emacs/ instead (i.e.,
relative to the present directory, ../../emacs/).

File emacs-acl2.el provides quite a few utilities.  Some make it easy
to use proof-trees (see :DOC proof-tree).  This file also loads the
ACL2-Doc Emacs browser for ACL2 documentation, and loads a file that
provides support for xdoc-link-mode, used by the web-based acl2+books
documentation.  See the top of emacs-acl2.el for more complete
documentation.
