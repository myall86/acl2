This directory contains some of the supporting materials for the paper
"Isomorphic Data Type Transformations" by Alessandro Coglio and Stephen
Westfold. The rest of the supporting materials are in other community books.

Tools:

- The implementation, documentation, and tests of the DEFISO tool described in
  the paper are in the community books [books]/kestrel/std/util/defiso*.lisp.

- The implementation, documentation, and tests of the ISODATA tool described in
  the paper are in the community books [books]/kestrel/apt/isodata*.lisp.

- The implementation, documentation, and tests of the PROPAGATE-ISO tool
  described in the paper will be added under [books]/kestrel/apt/ as well.

Examples:

- The "schematic" example in Section 3.2 of the paper is in the file
  schematic-example.lisp in this directory.

- The example described in Section 4.1 of the paper is in the file
  integer-example.lisp in this directory.

- The example described in Section 4.2 of the paper is in the file
  loop-example.lisp in this directory.

- The example described in Section 4.3 of the paper is in the subdirectory
  drone-plan. The drone-st state is defined in drone-plan/dp-impl-support.lisp.
  It's isomorphic type drone-state-ext is defined in drone-plan/dp-impl-support.lisp.
  The derivation of the isomorphic system is in drone-plan/refinement.lisp.
  A simple example showing execution of both the original system and the isomorphic
  system is in drone-plan/refinement.lisp.
