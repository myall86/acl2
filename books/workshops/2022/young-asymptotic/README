This directory contains the ACL2 file supporting proofs of asymptotic
complexity described in the paper "Modeling Asymptotic Complexity
Using ACL2" from the 2022 ACL2 Workshop.  The files should all certify
using the command:


mycert --acl2 /p/bin/acl2 *.lisp

where mycert is aliased to:
/v/filer4b/v8q001/acl2/v8-4/books/build/cert.pl

However, I believe that it should certify under other versions of ACL2.
