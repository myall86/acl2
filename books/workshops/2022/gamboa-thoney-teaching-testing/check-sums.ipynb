    "# Programming Assignment #4: Checksums\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore various uses of modular arithmetic to construct checksums, which are used extensively in error-detection and error-correction codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, there are two types of errors that can be detected or even better corrected. The first type is a change in one of the digits, e.g., a 7 can be changed to a 5. The sercond type is a swap of two adjacent digits, e.g., 147 can change to 417. Different techniques will detect and/or fix some of these errors.\n"

    "## Airline Ticket Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "When you buy a plane ticket, you may find a ticket id (different from your confirmation number). This is a 15-digit number, where the 15th digit is a checksum. In particular, the 15th digit is chosen such that it is equal to the remainder of the 14-digit number (of the first 14 digits) modulo 7. For example, the following is a valid airline ticket number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "because $12345678901234 \\bmod 7 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TODO-1 (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the function `(valid-ticket ID)` that verifies that the given ID, which is a list of 14 digits, is a valid airline ticket ID. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "    (valid-ticket '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 0)) = T\n",
    "    \n",
    "> Hint: I found it useful to write a function that extracts the ticket number from a ticket. E.g., the ticket number of the ticket above is 12,345,678,901,234.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint: You will need to define a data type for things like \"digit\" and \"list of digits\". Later, we will bd writing functions for things like \"lists of natural\" and try to pass a list of digits as an argument. Unfortunately, ACL2 will not allow this. Let's simplify things right now by telling ACL2 using `defthm` that a list of digits **is** a list of naturals. This will save you a lot of time later, so just do it now and forget it."

So we can't say that if we start with a valid ticket number, but somehow that number is garbled during transmission, we will definitely be able to detect that error. If we're unlucky (and it seems that is a 10% probability), we'll simply end up with another valid ticket number, even after a transmission failure. So the best we can hope for is that if *one* error happens during transmission, we should be able to detect that.\n",

    "Let's focus on errors of the first type, i.e., when a single digit is randomly changed. Suppose that as start with a valid ticket $A = a_1 a_2 \\dots a_{15}$ and end up with $B = a_1 a_2 \\dots b_i \\dots a_{15}$, where $a_i$ was replaced with $b_i$. We would like to show that ticket $B$ must be invalid. \n",

    "> Note: Unfortunately, this scheme for validating airline ticket numbers isn't strong enough to catch all 1-digit errors. For example, if the first digit is changed from a 2 to a 9, this does not affect the ticket number modulo 7, so the same checksum will work! The best we can hope for here is that `test?` will show up some counterexamples that will help us understand the limitations of our scheme, and maybe come up with a different scheme if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Note also that you can get very \"unlucky\" in that you end up replacing the kth digit with a digit d that just happens to be the same as the old digit at the kth position. So your condition that you're trying to test should take this into account!"

    "Now let's try the srecond type of error. Again, if we start with a valid ticket $A = a_1 a_2 \\dots a_{15}$ then transpose two digits to end up with ticket $B = a_1 a_2 \\dots a_{i+1} a_i \\dots a_{15}$, we would like to believe that ticket $B$ is invalid. Use `test?` to verify this property.  Your answer should be very similar to TODO-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Again, this conjecture is not true, so the real exercise is to see if the randomized testing helps us to understand the true properties of our code. In fact, suppose we transpose $a_i$ and ${i+1}$. Using properties of modulos (make sure you understand why), we see that $B$ will have the same checksum as $A$ if $10a_i + a_{i+1} \\equiv 10a_{i+1} + a_i \\pmod 7$. With a little algebra (make sure you know how), we can show that this is true precisely when $a_i \\equiv b_i \\pmod 7$, e.g., when we're transposing 07, 18, 29, 70, 81, or 92. In other words, the checksum is valid 6% of the time!"

This distinction is superficial. I.e., we could say that $a_9 \\euiv -(\\cdots) \\pmod {10}$ where $(\\cdots)$ is the weighted sum of the first eight digits. Also, in airline ticket numbers we computed a large number from the first 14 digits, whereas with bank routing numbers we are adding the digits but with different weights depending on the position. In fact, the weights idea is more general. Converting the digits to numbers is the same as using weights that are the powers of 10!

    "\n",
    "In this case, you should not see any counterexamples. Here's why. Suppose we change the first digit, so that $a_1\\ne b_1$. Then the sum of the other digits is completely unaffected, so the total sum changes only by $7a_1 - 7b_1 \\bmod 10$, where the \"7\" comes from the weight in the first position. In other words, the checksum does \\emph{not} change precisely when $7a_1 \\equiv 7b_1 \\pmod{10}$. When is that? Since 7 and 10 are relatively prime, this only happens when $a_1 \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{10}$. (For an explanation, you can multiply both sides of the first equation by $7^{-1} \\bmod 10$, and that exists because 7 and 10 are relatively prime. In particular, $3\\times7 =21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, so $7^{-1} \\bmod 10 = 3$.) So if $a_1$ is changed, the checksum has to change, too. That means that a singled-digit error will *always* be detected. So if you see some counterexamples, there is a bug in your code!\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, you could prove this in ACL2 by formalizing the argument in the previous paragraph (and generalizing it to all three different weights.) But that is so much work that I won't ask you to do it, even for extra credit. If you do want to pursue such proofs in ACL2, come see me about undergraduate research. Seriously, I have an idea that could turn this projecty into a nice publication for a student.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The reason this works is that the weights and the modulo are relatively prime. Since the modulo is 10, this means that the weights 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 are all bad. For example, if the weight is even, then the checksum will be the same if a 3 is changed to an 8."

    "## Credit Cards\n",
    "\n",
    "Many credit cards use the following checksum scheme. The credit card number is 16 digits, $A=a_1 a_2 \\dots a_{16}$ and these are summed using weights, as before. The weights are $2, 1, 2, 1, \\dots, 2, 1$. As before, the last digit is chosen so that the weighted sum (almost) is congruent to 0 modulo 10. But there's a twist. It's not just the sum that matters, it's actually\n",
    "$$2a_1 + a_2 + 2a_3 + a_4 + \\dots + 2a_{15} + a_{16} + \\text{number of $a_{\\text{odd } i}$ that are $\\ge 5$}$$\n",
    "What a weird twist! The number of $a_i$ (where $i$ is odd) that are $\\ge 5$. For example, consider the credit card number $4000~0012~3456~7899$. The $a_i$ for odd $i$ are $40~01~35~79$, and the number of those that are $\\ge 5$ is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Aside: If you took COSC 1010 at UW, you may remember this seemingly crazy validation scheme. Implementing this scheme in Java was a favorite exercise of the recently retired but long-serving COSC 1010 instructor at UW! First-year students can write the validation code, though they probably never guessed *why* it was defined this way. As you can probably guess by now, the reason has to do with modular arithmetic!\n",
    "\n",
    "So why this crazy scheme? As we saw earlier, using weights that are even means that a single digit $a_i$ can be replaced by another digit $b_i$ such that $|a_i-b_i|=5$ and this change goes undetected modulo 10. But, that's where the \"$\\ge 5$\" component comes in. If $|a_i-b_i|=5$, precisely one of them is $\\ge 5$, so if one is substituted for the other, the number of digits $\\ge 5$ changes by 1. And notice that we only count the digits in odd locations, *which are precisely the digits that have an even weight (i.e., 2).* That's why this scheme works to detect single-digit errors, even though we use even weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about a transposition error? Suppose that $a_1$ and $a_2$ are swapped. Then the weight will be the same if $(2a_1 + a_2) - (2a_2 + a_1) = a_1 - a_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod {10}$, which means that we can see a difference modulo 10 whenever $a_1 \\ne a_2$. But what about the $\\ge 5$ count? If $a_1 \\not\\ge 5$ but $a_2 \\ge 5$, then the count of digits in odd positions will increase by one. Can that offset the change of the digit sum modulo 10? Well, yes. The count increased by 1, so to offset it the sum needs to be $(2a_1 + a_2) - (2a_2 + a_1) = a_1 - a_2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {10}$. Remember that $-1 \\bmod 10 = 9$, so this means that an adjacent $90$ can be swapped with $09$ and be undetected.\n",

Then all weights and differences are (by definition) relatively prime to $N$. And it just so happens that $11$ is a prime number that's already close to 10!\n",

An ISBN has 10 digits $A = a_1 a_2 \\dots a_{10}$ and the tenth digit is chosen so that the weighted sum with the weights $\\langle 10, 9, 8, \\dots, 1\\rangle$ is equal to $0\\pmod{11}$. Since we're doing modulo 11, it is possible that the last \"digit\" must be 10, so the ISBN format allows the last digit to be 0-9 or X. For example, my favorite book of all time has ISBN 198480278X.\n",

    "## Postal Barcodes: Error Detection *and* Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how we can detect all one-digit and transposition errors using a weighted sum modulo a prime number, and the cost is simply having an extra digit in the message. If we allow even more overhead (i.e., a larger checksum), we can detect **and correct** these errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code we're going to explore is from the post office. You may have gotten mail with a yellow sticker attached, and in that sticker is a barcode with long and short lines&mdash;a list of ones and zeros, if you will. These are used to encode important information in a machine-readable format. In particular, the barcode has four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Zip code\n",
    "2. The extended 4-digit portion of the zip code\n",
    "3. a 2-digit code for presorting mail, e.g., a portion of the house number\n",
    "4. a checksum to make the sunm of all 12 digits equal to 0 modulo 10\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a code to my home address may look like `82063 9201 18 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait a minute. This system is using \"mod 10\" and doesn't have any weights, so how can it be able to detect and correct errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that the digits themselves are encoded into binary. So instead of having a list of 12 digits, it is actually a list of 60 bits. The encoding of digits to bits is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Digit   | Bits   | Digit   | Bits   | Digit   | Bits   | Digit   | Bits   | Digit   | Bits   |\n",
    "| ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |\n",
    "| 0       | 11000  | 1       | 00011  | 2       | 00101  | 3       | 00110  | 4       | 01001  |\n",
    "| 5       | 01010  | 6       | 01100  | 7       | 10001  | 8       | 10010  | 9       | 10100  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice we are using five bits to encode each digit, even though only four bits are necessary. That is the extra overhead we're paying to get error detection and correction.\n",

    "How does this work? First, notice that all 5-bit code have three 0s and two 1s. If you are writing this code in December, then you can answer the question, \"How many ways can you write down exactly three 0s and two 1s?\". (Hint: It's 5!/3!2! = 10.) So there is a unique code for each digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose a single bit flips from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. Then we can tell exactly which digit is encoded incorrectly, since that digit will no longer have exactly three 0s and two 1s. Suppose we know that the first digit has an error. Then we can use the \"mod 10\" checksum to find what that digit must be! (Realize that the weights are all 1s, which are relatively prime to 10, so single errors in the **digits** can be detected.) Since we know what the right digit should have been, it's easy to replace the five bits that correspond to that digit with the correct five bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about transposition errors? Suppose a transposition occurs within the five bits for a given digit. Then the digit will change to another *valid* digit. (Remember, there are exactly ten bit patterns with threee 0s and two 1s, so swapping two bits will result in another one of those ten bit patterns.) The \"mod 10\" checksum will detect that there's an error, but there is no way to discover which of the digits is wrong. So this error is not corrected. On the other hand, if a transposition occurs at the boundary of two digits, then both digits will have invalid 5-bit patterns. That means we know which two bits were transposed (at the boundary of the two illegal digits), and we can swap them back to correct the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this scheme detects all one-bit and transposition errors, and corrects all one-bit errors and many transposition errors. Since this is intended for computer communication, one-bit errors are common but transposition errors are not. (Transposition errors are common to humans&mdash;just see all the typos in this assignment, for example. But computers just don't make those kind of mistakes. On the other hand, computers are more likely to have a one-bit error during transmission, due to faulty wiring, cosmic rays, disk failures, etc.) So this is a very effective error detection and (mostly) correction scheme! \n",
