Book Certification
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To certify books, execute the following:

make ACL2r=<Path of the ACL2r image>

To remove certificate files, etc., execute the following:

make clean ACL2r=<Path of the ACL2r image>

See Makefile file for the detail.

The orthogonality relations of trigonometric functions (5.1), (5.2),
and (5.3) described in the paper are formalized in sines-orthog.lisp,
cosines-orthog.lisp, and sine-cosine-orthog.lisp respectively.

The sum rule for integration of indexed sums is formalized in
int-sum.lisp.

The Fourier coefficient formulas is formalized in
fourier-coefficients.lisp.

The uniqueness of Fourier sums is formalized in fourier-sums.lisp.

The sum rule for integration of infinite series is formalized in
int-infinite-sum-1.lisp and int-infinite-sum-2.lisp, corresponding to
two conditions described in Section 8 of the paper respectively.
