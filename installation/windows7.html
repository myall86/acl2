	<title>Helpful Instructions for Setting up ACL2 and Windows</title>

    <h1>Helpful Instructions for Setting up <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</A> and Windows</h1>

        <p> We thank David Rager for providing
        instructions, which we include verbatim below and expect apply to
        future versions.  Note: We recommend using CCL for Windows
        builds, in part so that interrupts (Control-C) will work.  But
        first, a remark:</p>

<p>At least one user has built ACL2 on Windows 10 in July, 2016 by
following the instructions below, using the "bleeding edge" versions
of CCL, mingw, and ACL2.  This user said the the bleeding edge
versions might not be necessary, but with older versions there were
too many times that the ACL2 build was hanging.  Even with the
bleeding edge versions there were some hangs, but it wasn't clear if
that was the fault of CCL, Mingw, MSys, or something else.  This user
explained further:</p>

<blockquote>

The problem with hangs: It seems that while compiling ACL2 there were
a few times when it simply hung.  But apparently this is
non-deterministic.  Simply cleaning and retrying several times managed
to get me out of the problem.

	<p><b><font color="red">Here are David Rager's instructions.</font></b></p>

	<p> I was able to get ACL2  3.6.1 to install and build the regression suite
	on Windows 7 with the following steps.  I did not have to install
	cygwin.</p>


	<ol>
	  <li><p>Install MinGW.  At the time of this writing, the following direct link works<br />

		<a
		href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/MinGW%205.1.6/MinGW-5.1.6.exe/download">MinGW-5.1.6.exe</a></p>

		<p>If that direct link doesn't work, click on "Automated MinGW Installer"
		on the more general <a
		href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/">MinWG project files
		page</a>.</p>

		</li>

	  <li><p>Install MSys.  At the time of this writing, the following direct link
		  works<br />

		  <a
			href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS%20Base%20System/msys-1.0.11/MSYS-1.0.11.exe/download">MSYS-1.0.11.exe</a></p>

		<p>If that direct link doesn't work, click on "MSYS Base System" on the
		  more general <a
			href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/">MinWG project files
			page</a>.</p>

	  </li>


	  <li>Add "C:\msys\1.0\bin" to my environment variable "path".  The way you
	  do this varies with each Windows XP/Vista/7.  Roughly speaking, you need
	  to go to the control panel, and open up your system settings.  Get to the
	  advanced system settings and click on environment variables.  Edit the
	  "path" environment variable and add ";C:\msys\1.0\bin" to it.  At this
	  point you might need to restart your computer, but I did not have to do
	  so on Windows 7.  I did, however, have to restart my emacs.</li>

	  <li><p>Realize that using "\" to indicate paths in windows confuses some
	  linux programs and that you might need to use "/" sometimes.</p></li>

	  <li>
		<p>After expanding the ACL2 sources, cd to that directory and type
		  something similar to the following (modify it to set LISP to your LISP
		  executable<sup>1</sup>)<br />

		  <code>make LISP=c:/ccl/wx86cl64.exe</code><br />

		  The "make.exe" that will be used is intentionally the MSys version,
		  not the MinGW version.</p>
	  </li>

	  <li>After your ACL2 image builds, make acl2 executable, specifically

		<ul>
		  <li>Remove the "$*" from the saved_acl2 script (because Windows does
			not understand $*). Consequently, any arguments you pass to ACL2 via
			the command line will be ignored.</li>

		  <li>Rename saved_acl2 to saved_acl2.bat, for example by executing the
			following command: <code>rename saved_acl2 saved_acl2.bat</code></li>
		</ul>
	  </li>

	  <li><p>You can now make the regression suite by typing<br />
		<code>make regression ACL2=c:/acl2-3.6.1/acl2-sources/saved_acl2.bat</code>
		</p>
              <p>[Note added later: you may need to add `<code>make</code>' option
              <code>ACL2_CENTAUR=skip</code>, for example if you have
              issues with Perl.]</p></li>
	</ol>

	<p><sup>1</sup>I have intentionally ommitted instructions on how to setup a
	LISP on windows.  However, I include one link that should suffice: <a

	CCL</a></p>
