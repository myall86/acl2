NOTE: This directory is maintained for Emacs 24.  If you are using
more recent versions of Emacs, consider using files in books/emacs/
instead (i.e., relative to the present directory, ../books/emacs/).

File emacs-acl2.el provides quite a few utilities.  Some make it easy
to use proof-trees (see :DOC proof-tree).  This file also loads the
ACL2-Doc Emacs browser for ACL2 documentation, and loads a file that
provides support for xdoc-link-mode, used by the web-based acl2+books
documentation.  See the top of emacs-acl2.el for more complete
documentation.
